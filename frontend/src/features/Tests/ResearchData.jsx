        <strong>Rethinking Intelligence Testing and Racial Disparities</strong>
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        For decades, intelligence tests have shown that ethnic minorities and
        people from lower-income backgrounds tend to score lower than white,
        middle-class individuals. These patterns have sparked ongoing debates
        about what causes these differences—and what they really mean.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        One of the most controversial arguments came from psychologist Arthur
        Jensen in 1969. He claimed that up to 80% of the difference in IQ scores
        was due to genetics. Years later, <em>The Bell Curve</em> by Herrnstein
        and Murray (1994) suggested that racial differences in IQ might also
        have a biological basis. While their writing avoided overtly racist
        language, their conclusions supported policies that would have
        negatively impacted Black and Latino communities, such as limiting
        immigration or childbearing.

      <br />

      <p>
        These ideas have since been widely challenged and discredited. More
        recent research shows that when you control for factors like education,
        income, and living environment, IQ score differences across racial
        groups shrink dramatically—or disappear entirely. For instance, Alfano
        and colleagues (2016) stressed that intelligence is not a fixed trait
        determined by genes. Instead, it’s shaped by many overlapping
        influences, including one’s environment.
      </p>
      <br />

        Psychologists Lawrence Weiss and Donald Saklofske studied the popular
        Wechsler IQ tests and found that what looked like racial IQ differences
        were often really about environment. When they adjusted for factors like
        parent education and income, score differences dropped by 65% for white
        children, 78% for Black children, and completely vanished for Latinx
        children (Weiss, 2020).
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Other studies back this up. Research by Diaz-Venegas and Castora-Binkley
        found that when researchers accounted for age, education, income,
        gender, and health, cognitive performance across racial groups was
        essentially the same. This shows that access to education and other
        social conditions—not race—play the biggest role in shaping test
        results.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        There’s also growing recognition of a key concept called measurement
        invariance. This means that for a test like an IQ test to be fair, it
        needs to measure the same thing in the same way for all groups. If test
        results change depending on someone’s race, culture, or language
        background, the test’s fairness and accuracy are in question.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In summary: Race and ethnicity do not cause lower IQ scores. The real
        drivers behind score differences are access to education, income level,
        exposure to language and learning opportunities, and whether tests are
        designed with cultural fairness in mind.
