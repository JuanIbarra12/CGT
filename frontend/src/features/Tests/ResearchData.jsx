        Throughout the history of intelligence testing, ethnic minorities and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have consistently scored lower than white, middle-class counterparts. These disparities have long fueled debates regarding the causes and implications of such score differences.

        One of the most controversial claims originated from Jensen (1969) who argued in the Harvard Review that approximately 80% of IQ variance was genetic. Decades later, Herrnstein and Murray (1994) echoed similar ideas in their publication "The Bell Curve," suggesting racial IQ differences had a biological basis. While neither made overtly racist claims, their conclusions supported policies that targeted Black and Latino populations through proposed limitations on childbearing and immigration screening.

        These views have since been widely refuted. Newer research has found that when variables like education, income, and environment are controlled, the gaps in IQ scores significantly diminish or disappear altogether. Alfano et al. (2016) emphasized that intelligence emerges from the interaction of multiple overlapping processes — not a single genetic trait — and must be interpreted within environmental contexts.

        Lawrence G. Weiss and Donald H. Saklofske conducted extensive analysis on the Wechsler scales and found that environmental factors “masquerade” as racial or ethnic IQ differences. For example, when parent education and income were statistically controlled in Wechsler scores, variance dropped by 65% for white children, 78% for Black children, and was entirely eliminated for Latinx children (Weiss, 2020).

        Similarly, research by Diaz-Venegas et al. (2016) and Castora-Binkley et al. (2015) found equivalent cognitive performance across racial groups after controlling for age, education, gender, poverty, and health status. These findings suggest that socioeconomic and educational factors are primary contributors to test score differences.

        The concept of “measurement invariance” has gained traction, arguing that a construct (like IQ) must be measured consistently across different groups to be valid. If a test’s results are influenced by group membership (race, culture, language), then its validity is compromised.
      </p>
      <br />

        In short, the data shows that race and ethnicity alone do not account for disparities in test scores. Instead, the primary drivers are education access, income level, exposure to language and academic content, and culturally relevant test design.
