        Psychological assessment, specifically cognitive assessment, is a successful predictor of academic success (Schmidt & Hunter, 2016). From its early days of mental testing, its use in academic settings has been useful in identifying students who did not benefit from normative educational settings.

        The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) was the most widely used test measuring an individual’s Intelligent Quotient (IQ) and has widely been known for its reliability of scores (Gomez, 2016) before being updated to its current WISC-V edition. The current research seems to support that psychological testing specifically measures current academic abilities including identifying learning disabilities but does not have predictive validity over long academic periods (Roth et al., 2015).

        Additionally, the most recurring criticism found in today’s psychological testing is the validity of the test construction, specifically as it pertains to its normative sample (Sehrawat & Sehrawat, 2017). Research has found that general samples used in test construction are not representative of within-group populations in diverse cultures (Shuttleworth-Edwards 2016; Alfano et al., 2017). Studies explain that standardization methods fail to capture accurate representation samples of individuals with an advantage background versus those that do not have a formal education.

        Historically speaking, tests have been biased towards ethnic minorities and constructed using white, middle-class Americans (Henrich et al., 2010; Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests, 2016). As you have read from its history, intelligence tests have an imperfect background of working with minority populations and specifically have not favored immigrants with limited English language development.

        Intelligence testing is used to identify Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs) such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. It is estimated that 34% of all school-aged youth receiving special education services in U.S. schools have a primary diagnosis of SLD (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). SLDs are characterized by academic achievement deficits (Fletcher et al., 2019) and are commonly identified when there is a discrepancy between total intelligence scores and achievement scores (reading, writing, and math).

        Oftentimes, English Learners (EL) are misidentified as having SDLs (Barrio, 2017) and 76% of those ELs are Latinx students (National Clearinghouse English Language Acquisition, 2018).

        Cognitive testing is also used in identifying neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disability (ID), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These assessments play a critical role in differential diagnosis, especially in young children, as noted in multiple studies including Oh (2016) and Szatmari et al. (2016).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While cognitive testing is a valuable tool in diagnosing learning disabilities and developmental disorders, it is equally important to consider cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic variables that could influence scores. Without doing so, test results may misrepresent an individual’s actual abilities and lead to inappropriate educational placements or clinical interventions.
