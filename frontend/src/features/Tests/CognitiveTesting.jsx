        Understanding the Role and Limitations of Cognitive Testing in Education
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Cognitive testing—often referred to as psychological or intelligence
        testing—has long been used to predict academic success (Schmidt &
        Hunter, 2016). From its early beginnings, these assessments have helped
        identify students who struggle in traditional classroom settings.

        One of the most well-known intelligence tests is the Wechsler Adult
        Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), which has been widely recognized for its
        reliable results (Gomez, 2016). It has since evolved into newer
        versions, such as the WISC-V, which is used for children. While these
        tests are helpful in identifying current academic abilities and learning
        challenges, research shows they are not always reliable at predicting
        long-term academic outcomes (Roth et al., 2015).

        A common concern with these tests is how they are created—especially
        regarding the groups of people used to develop the “norms” or average
        scores (Sehrawat & Sehrawat, 2017). Studies have found that the
        populations used to design these tests often don’t represent the full
        range of cultural and educational backgrounds found in today’s schools
        (Shuttleworth-Edwards, 2016; Alfano et al., 2017). As a result, the
        tests may be more accurate for students from privileged backgrounds than
        for those from diverse or underserved communities.

        Historically, intelligence tests have been biased in favor of white,
        middle-class Americans (Henrich et al., 2010; CNPAAMEI, 2016). This has
        led to unfair disadvantages for ethnic minorities and immigrants,
        particularly those still developing English language skills.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Cognitive testing is widely used to diagnose Specific Learning
        Disabilities (SLDs), such as dyslexia (reading difficulties), dysgraphia
        (writing difficulties), and dyscalculia (math difficulties). About 34%
        of students receiving special education in the U.S. are diagnosed with
        an SLD (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). These
        disabilities are typically identified when there’s a significant gap
        between a student’s intelligence test scores and their academic
        performance (Fletcher et al., 2019).
      </p>
      <br />

        However, English Learners (ELs) are sometimes misdiagnosed with learning
        disabilities simply because of language barriers. Research shows that
        76% of ELs in U.S. schools are Latinx, making this an especially
        important issue for that group (Barrio, 2017; National Clearinghouse for
        English Language Acquisition, 2018).
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In addition to SLDs, cognitive testing is also used to help diagnose
        neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
        Intellectual Disability (ID), and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
        Disorder (ADHD). These tools are especially helpful for early diagnosis
        in young children (Oh, 2016; Szatmari et al., 2016). While cognitive
        testing can provide valuable insight into a person’s learning profile,
        it’s essential to consider cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic
        factors when interpreting results. Without this context, test outcomes
        may not accurately reflect a person’s true abilities—and could lead to
        incorrect diagnoses or inappropriate educational placements.
