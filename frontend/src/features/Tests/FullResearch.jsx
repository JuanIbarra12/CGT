      <p><strong>History of Psychological Testing:</strong> It is well documented that psychological testing in the United States has a history of controversial practices...</p><br />
      <p>During the turn of the 20th century U.S. psychologists adopted scales from Alfred Binet... American Universities (including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Stanford)...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Modern Era of Psychological Tests:</strong> As previously mentioned, the first standardized test was developed to identify children with learning disabilities...</p><br />
      <p>The U.S. Military is credited with conducting the first large-scaled test... referred to as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)...</p><br />
      <p>Psychological assessment, specifically cognitive assessment, is a successful predictor of academic success... recurring criticism found in today’s psychological testing is the validity of the test construction...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Defining Intelligence:</strong> The conceptualization of intelligence is also a controversial topic... the phrase “g factor” was termed by Spearman (1904)...</p><br />
      <p>Later came theories by Thurstone (1938), Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983), Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory (1985)... and eventually the CHC Theory...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) Theory:</strong> CHC combines fluid (Gf) and crystallized (Gc) intelligence... layered as Stratum I (narrow), Stratum II (broad), and Stratum III (general ability)...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Common Clinical Uses:</strong> Psychological tests are used to identify Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and ADHD...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Neurocognitive Disorders:</strong> Cognitive testing is also used to identify neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and dementia, particularly in aging populations...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Differences in Scores Among Ethnic Groups:</strong> Jensen (1969) and Herrnstein & Murray (1994) posited controversial genetic explanations, now widely refuted... Studies show SES and education explain most variance...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Normative Data:</strong> Normative scores must reflect cultural and language diversity... Standardized norms often overlook regional differences within Latinx populations...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Social Determinants:</strong> Studies by Weiss (2020) and others show how parent education, income, and early childhood experiences drive score differences, not ethnicity itself...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Latinx and Assessment:</strong> The Latinx population in the U.S. faces major disparities in test accessibility, language match, and cultural representation... 60 million+ strong, but underserved...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Factors That Explain Score Differences in Latinx Populations:</strong> These include language fluency, level of formal schooling, cultural familiarity with test content, and the proficiency of the examiner...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Language Factors:</strong> Tests often administered by bilinguals without formal Spanish education... differences between BICS and CALP proficiency levels are not always understood or measured...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Interpreter Use:</strong> While common, untrained interpreters risk test validity. Research supports trained interpreters or bilingual clinicians wherever possible...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Normative Gaps:</strong> Most Spanish-language tests were normed in specific countries (e.g., Puerto Rico or Spain) and don’t generalize to all Latinx subgroups in the U.S...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Cultural Factors:</strong> Even non-verbal tests can carry cultural bias... Studies show false positives due to cultural unfamiliarity with figures, instructions, or contexts...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Recent Norm Updates:</strong> Adjusted scores now account for variables like primary caregiver, years of schooling in U.S. vs abroad... offering better cultural relevance...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Assess bilingual dominance, use culturally adapted tools like CLIM, validate language proficiency, and follow APA & IDEA ethical guidelines...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Ethical Standards:</strong> APA Section 9 and IDEA §300.304 require tests to be free from racial/cultural bias and administered in the test-taker’s native language...</p><br />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Differences in scores are mostly eliminated when controlling for language, culture, SES, and education. Testing must be contextualized to avoid misdiagnosis, stigma, and unequal treatment.</p><br />
